Deep Sea Prospector is a 2D pixel-style casual resource collection game developed using the p5.js library. Inspired by the classic game Gold Miner, our project reinterprets the core gameplay within an ocean exploration setting. Players control a hook deployed from a boat to capture various underwater objects and accumulate as many points as possible within a limited time, progressing through increasingly challenging levels with higher score requirements.

The game features a wide variety of collectible objects, including fish of different sizes, shells, pearls, stones, and treasure chests. Each item is designed with distinct attributes such as weight, movement speed, and value, creating a dynamic and strategic gameplay experience. While high-value targets like large fish and pearls offer greater rewards, players must carefully avoid low-value or obstructive items such as rocks and fish bones, which can significantly reduce efficiency and waste valuable time.

To enhance playability and replayability, a shop system is introduced between levels, where players can spend their accumulated score on items with diverse effects. At least three items are randomly generated in each visit, including both consumable and persistent upgrades, encouraging strategic resource management. In addition, purchasing a submarine unlocks the “Deep Sea Mode,” a high-risk, high-reward environment featuring limited visibility, dangerous predators such as sharks, and more valuable targets.

## 📋 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Ideation Process

<div align="center">

**Paper Prototype of Deep Sea Prospector**
<br><br>
<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fca9d025-2279-4b16-b439-3e32f4e623b9" controls width="1500"></video>

</div>

Our initial goal was to create an accessible arcade-style game with a highly responsive feedback loop. We briefly considered a Fruit Ninja-style slicing concept, but discarded it for lacking gameplay depth, and a Contra-style shooter, which proved too technically complex for our project scope.

Instead, we chose a resource collection model inspired by Gold Miner. This approach offered a manageable development scope while still emphasizing timing, precision, and risk-reward mechanics. After refining the game's balance through paper prototyping and positive peer feedback, we finalized Deep Sea Prospector, focusing on intuitive controls, satisfying feedback, and a scalable core loop.


### 3.2 Stakeholder table

To support the development of Deep Sea Prospector, we identified key stakeholders and analyzed their needs to guide design decisions. Our primary focus was on different player types, including casual players, challenge seekers, and multiplayer users, each with distinct expectations regarding gameplay simplicity, difficulty, and interaction.

We also considered internal stakeholders such as developers and designers, whose requirements influenced system implementation and visual design. In addition, evaluators (e.g., lecturers and playtesters) were treated as surrogate stakeholders, providing valuable feedback that reflects broader user perspectives.

User needs were formalized using the “As a…, I want…, so that…” structure and translated into testable acceptance criteria with the Given–When–Then format. This approach ensured a clear, user-centered, and implementable design process.

### 3.3 Reflection

To manage development effectively, we utilized a Value vs. Effort Matrix, prioritizing high-impact, low-effort features to maintain steady progress while avoiding overly complex visual designs.

We also established strict user acceptance criteria to define our core gameplay. This ensured instantly responsive hook controls and clear, time-limited score progression. To deepen the risk-reward dynamic, we introduced advanced elements like "Deep Sea Mode," featuring reduced visibility, hostile creatures, and rare time-sensitive targets.

Finally, stakeholder analysis guided us in balancing player experience with technical feasibility and aesthetics, ensuring the game seamlessly integrated usability with practical implementation constraints.

### 3.4 Use-Case Diagram

<div align="center">

Figure 8: Use Case Diagram
  
  <img src="progress/week5/UseCase.png" alt="Use Case Diagram" width="800">
  
</div>

We utilized a use case diagram to structure the core components of Deep Sea Prospector and clearly map player interactions. The diagram outlines a linear flow: players select a game mode and difficulty, then engage in the central loop of controlling the hook, avoiding hazards, and accumulating points within a time limit.

It also captures secondary systems extending beyond the core loop, such as post-level shop purchases, unlocking "Deep Sea Mode," leaderboards, and collections. Ultimately, this diagram served as a stable foundation, guiding our iterative development while keeping the system's overall functionality clearly defined.

## 📐 4. Design

### 4.1 System Architecture Overview

## Technical Architecture

*Deep Sea Prospector* utilizes a modular, object-oriented architecture built on the **Single Responsibility Principle**. By separating game state, level control, player progression, and core mechanics into distinct logical layers, we ensure high cohesion and low coupling. This allows subsystems to evolve independently, keeping the project maintainable and scalable.

### Core Components

* **`GameManager`**: Acts as the central controller, coordinating major subsystems and seamlessly managing state transitions (e.g., title screen, gameplay, shop, results).
* **`LevelManager`**: Configures level-specific parameters like target scores, time limits, and difficulty scaling, while handling the dynamic spawning of creatures and items.
* **`ShopManager`**: Oversees the in-game economy by refreshing available items, processing purchase transactions, and tracking player inventory.
* **`Player`**: Manages player progression, tracking gold accumulation, active upgrades, and gameplay input.
* **`Hook`**: Drives the core mechanics. It handles the swinging motion, launch behavior, collision detection, and incorporates weight-based physics for realistic item retrieval.
* **`SeaItems`**: An abstract base class defining a unified interface for all interactable entities (treasures, fish, obstacles), enabling polymorphic behavior and consistent interaction logic.


### 4.2 Class Diagram

<div align="center">

Figure 9: Class diagram showing the object-oriented structure of Deep Sea Prospector.

  <img src="progress/week5/LevelManager Player State-2026-04-21-135515.png" alt="Class Diagram" width="800">
</div>

The Deep Sea Prospector architecture follows a modular, object-oriented design to ensure system extensibility. GameManager acts as the central hub, coordinating the LevelManager (gameplay loop), Player (progression), and ShopManager (economy). It utilizes GameState and Difficulty enumerations to maintain logic consistency across different game phases.

For game entities, GameObject serves as the abstract base class for both Hook and SeaItem. SeaItem leverages polymorphism, allowing subclasses to implement specific movement behaviors and weights. These physical attributes directly influence the Hook's retrieval speed, creating a satisfying risk-reward loop. This decoupled structure allows for seamless integration of new marine life or shop upgrades without altering core mechanics.


### 4.3 Sequence Diagrams

#### 4.3.1 Game Initialization and Level Start

<div align="center">

Figure 10: Sequence diagram illustrating the game initialization flow from difficulty selection to level start.

  <img src="progress/week5/SequenceDiagram1.png" alt="Sequence Diagram 1 - Game Start" width="800">
</div>

This sequence diagram demonstrates the transition from the UI menu to the active game state:

•	State Transition: The process begins when the player confirms their selection; the GameManager calls changeState(GameState.PLAYING).

•	Object Instantiation: The GameManager initializes a new LevelManager, passing parameters such as currentDifficulty, levelNum, and the player instance.

•	Environment Configuration: The LevelManager calculates the targetScore and timeLimit based on the difficulty. It then checks player.hasSubmarine to set the isDeepSea flag and triggers the spawning of SeaItem subclasses (e.g., BaseFish, Treasure) according to the level configuration.


#### 4.3.2 Hook Capture Mechanism

<div align="center">

Figure 11: Sequence diagram showing the hook deployment, collision detection, and item retrieval process.

  <img src="progress/week5/SequenceDiagram2.png" alt="Sequence Diagram 2 - Hook Capture" width="800">
</div>

This sequence highlights the real-time physics interaction between the player’s input and game entities:

•	Deployment: When a down-arrow input is detected, the GameManager triggers hook.deployDown(). The Hook transitions from IDLE_SWINGING to MOVING_DOWN, increasing its length each frame.

•	Collision and Grabbing: The system performs continuous collision detection. Once a hit is confirmed, the Hook calls grabItem(item), attaches the SeaItem, and switches to the MOVING_UP state.

•	Weighted Retrieval: During retrieval, the Hook executes moveWithItem(). The moveSpeed is dynamically adjusted based on the attached item's weight, simulating physical resistance.

•	Data Synchronization: Upon reaching the origin, returnComplete() is triggered. The LevelManager calls player.addScore(item.scoreValue) to update the persistent score before the item is destroyed.


#### 4.3.3 Level Completion and Result Evaluation

</div>

This diagram illustrates the logic governing win/loss conditions and the subsequent state cleanup:

•	Timer Monitoring: The LevelManager updates its internal timer during each update() cycle. When the time expires, it halts gameplay to evaluate the player's performance.

•	Condition Checking: The system compares the player.totalScore against the required targetScore.

•	State Finalization: The LevelManager communicates the outcome to the GameManager. The GameManager then calls changeState(GameState.LEVEL_RESULT), rendering the appropriate result screen. Finally, it interacts with the HighScoreManager to save the session data.


### 4.4 Design Patterns and Principles

Our architecture applies several key design patterns to ensure scalability and maintainability:

* **State Pattern**: `GameManager` manages game flow transitions (TITLE, PLAYING, SHOP, RESULT), while the `Hook` uses behavior states (IDLE, MOVING_DOWN, MOVING_UP) to encapsulate logic and prevent input conflicts.
* **Factory Pattern & Inheritance**: `LevelManager` dynamically spawns entities using a Factory pattern. The `SeaItem` base class ensures high reusability and simplifies adding new marine objects.
* **Observer Pattern**: Event callbacks (e.g., `onCollision`, `returnComplete`) create loose coupling between the `Hook` and items, facilitating easy extension and independent testing.

**Agile Evolution:** Following Agile methodologies, we refactored our initially monolithic controller logic by separating rendering from core physics. This modularity ensured smooth performance (especially in "Deep Sea Mode") and allowed us to safely tune the risk-reward balance without disrupting foundational code.

## 💻 5. Implementation

### 5.1 Overview

*Deep Sea Prospector* was built using **P5.js**. Our implementation focused on three interconnected goals, which drove our primary technical challenges:

* **Physics & Collision:** Implementing responsive, physics-based hook mechanics with multi-state collision detection.
* **Progression Balancing:** Designing fair score and economy scaling across *Shallow Water* and *Deep Sea* modes using a mathematically guided, expected-value framework.
* **Cloud Integration:** Building a lightweight cloud-backed leaderboard and fish collection index to boost replayability without introducing heavy data-fetch overhead.

### 5.2 Technical Challenge 1: Physics-Based Hook Mechanics and Collision System

The core gameplay revolves around the hook mechanism, which required implementing several interconnected systems to achieve smooth, responsive, and realistic behavior.

**Hook State Machine Implementation**

The hook operates through a finite state machine with three primary states: `IDLE_SWINGING`, `MOVING_DOWN`, and `MOVING_UP`. The swinging motion uses trigonometric functions to create a pendulum effect:

```javascript
angle = sin(frameCount * swingSpeed) * maxSwingAngle;
hookX = pivotX + sin(angle) * ropeLength;
hookY = pivotY + cos(angle) * ropeLength;
```

When the player presses the down arrow key, the hook transitions to `MOVING_DOWN` state, fixing the current angle and extending the rope linearly. This required careful synchronization between the visual representation and the underlying physics model to ensure the hook moves smoothly without visual artifacts.

**Collision Detection System**

Implementing accurate collision detection between the hook and various sea objects presented significant challenges. We employed a distance-based collision detection approach using P5.js's `dist()` function:

```javascript
let d = dist(
    hook.position.x,
    hook.position.y,
    item.position.x,
    item.position.y,
);
if (d < item.catchRadius) {
    /* collision detected */
}
```

The system manages multiple object types with distinct collision and spawn behaviors:
* **Behavior Rules:** Fish and treasures attach to the hook, rocks trigger immediate retraction, and sharks destroy captured items.
* **Custom Hitboxes (`catchRadius`):** Objects use tailored bounds (e.g., tighter hitboxes for `BigFish`). This adds strategic depth by rewarding players who master true collision boundaries over visual size.
* **Overlap Prevention:** A `checkOverlap()` system runs during initialization to ensure all static items (treasures, rocks, pearls) maintain a 10-20 pixel separation, avoiding frustrating spawn clusters.

**Weight-Based Physics**

The retrieval phase implements weight-based physics where heavier objects slow down the hook's ascent speed. The retrieval speed calculation uses the formula:

```javascript
retrievalSpeed = baseSpeed / (1 + itemWeight * weightFactor);
```

This creates strategic depth as players must balance the value of heavy items against the time cost of retrieving them, especially when approaching the level time limit.

</p>
<br>

### 5.3 Technical Challenge 2: Mathematical Game Balance and Expected Value Framework

The second major technical challenge involved designing a comprehensive game balance system that ensures fair difficulty progression and meaningful strategic choices. Rather than arbitrary score assignments, we developed a mathematical framework to systematically evaluate and balance all catchable items based on expected value optimization.

**Expected Value Framework for Game Design**

We developed an expected value formula to guide our game balance decisions. When designing each item's score value, we consider the player's expected return per unit time invested. The ultimate expected value ($EV$) for targeting a specific item is calculated as:

$$
EV = \frac{E_{theory}}{DF} = \frac{S \cdot 60 \cdot R_{eff}}{50 \cdot D \cdot \left( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{\max(1, 5 - W)} \right) \cdot (1 + 0.3 \cdot V)}
$$

Where:

- $S$ = Item score value (the variable we're designing)
- $D$ = Average distance to target (normalized to typical gameplay distances)
- $W$ = Item weight (SmallFish 2-3, BigFish 6-9, AnglerFish 6-10)
- $V$ = Velocity factor for moving targets (0 for stationary, 0.2-2.5 for fish)
- $R_{eff}$ = Effective capture rate considering player skill and difficulty
- $DF$ = Difficulty factor accounting for miss probability and wasted time

**Formula Components and Design Rationale**

The numerator $S \cdot 60 \cdot R_{eff}$ represents theoretical score gain per minute, scaled by capture success rate. The denominator accounts for multiple cost factors that players implicitly evaluate:

1. **Distance Cost** — $50 \cdot D$ converts pixel distance to time-equivalent metric (at 5 pixels/frame descent speed)
2. **Weight Penalty** — $\left( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{\max(1, 5 - W)} \right)$ exponentially increases cost for heavier items due to slower retrieval
3. **Velocity Penalty** — $(1 + 0.3 \cdot V)$ penalizes fast-moving targets harder to predict and intercept

**Practical Application: Score Balancing**

Using this framework, we systematically balanced all item scores. For example, SmallFish (70-110 pts, weight 2-3, speed 1.2-1.6) have high $EV$ due to abundance and easy capture, serving as reliable "filler" items. BigFish (220-340 pts, weight 6-9, speed 0.3-0.8) offer medium $EV$ with high risk-reward ratio, as heavy weight significantly reduces retrieval speed. AnglerFish (400-800 pts, weight 6-10, speed 0.2-0.5) provide highest $EV$ in deep sea mode, justified by limited visibility and increased difficulty. This mathematical approach ensured consistent difficulty scaling between Shallow Water and Deep Sea modes, validated through our NASA TLX evaluation showing appropriate workload increases without overwhelming players.

### 5.4 Technical Challenge 3: Shared Leaderboard and Fish Collection Index



Beyond the two core technical challenges above, we also implemented a shared leaderboard and a collection-style fish gallery to strengthen replay motivation and social comparison. The key design goal was to keep cloud synchronization lightweight while still preserving meaningful run history.
<br>

  <img src="docs/evaluation report figure/data.png" width="90%" alt="Live Database Records">
</div>

#### Cloud-Synced Score Records with Structured Catch Data

The leaderboard is managed by `HighScoreManager`, which persists local scores in `localStorage` and synchronizes to Supabase on the production deployment. Instead of uploading image assets or bulky binary payloads, each score entry stores structured JSON fields (player name, score, difficulty, mode, and `catch_history`). This design keeps API requests small and fast while preserving the data needed for post-run analysis and display.

```javascript
body: JSON.stringify({
    player_name: name,
    score: score,
    levels_completed: levelsCompleted,
    difficulty: d,
    player_mode: p,
    catch_history: ch,
    per_level_earned: ple,
    per_level_spawn_value: pls,
}),
```
<br>
<p align="center">
  <font color="#888888">Figure 17: Cloud-synced leaderboard data structure</font><br><br>
  <img src="docs/gif/board.gif" width="70%" alt="Leaderboard Database Demo">
</p>

#### Fish Collection Gallery via Indexed Keys

To support the gallery efficiently, catches are converted into stable indexed keys at runtime (for example, `fish1`–`fish64`, plus named special fish). `LevelManager` accumulates these counts in `fishCaught`, and `GameManager` merges them into session-wide history before submission. The gallery then maps those keys to preloaded sprite arrays (`imgSmallFishes`, `imgBigFishes`, and special fish assets), so rendering a player's collection requires only numeric counts from the database, not remote image downloads.

This indexing approach gave us the “Pokemon-style” collection feedback loop while avoiding heavy fetch overhead, improving responsiveness on both desktop and lower-bandwidth connections.

### 6.2 Quantitative Evaluation

We evaluated usability quantitatively, using two well-established, validated questionnaires and statistical analyses, to ensure the game was both sufficiently challenging and easy to use.

- **Raw NASA TLX** — to measure perceived workload
- **System Usability Scale (SUS)** — to test system usability quantitatively
- **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test** — to estimate the statistical significance of the evaluations

#### Process

These evaluations involved 10 participants, each trialing two difficulty modes. Initially, participants struggled to understand the control key of the gameplay, urging us to add short documentation.

#### Raw NASA TLX

**Subscale Workload Scores**

Across all six subscales, the median scores for all participants illustrated a tiny increase with the variance in the level of difficulty (Table 5). The change in median scores only varies slightly.

Table 5: Median NASA TLX subscale scores for all participants

| Scale                          | Median (easy) | Median (Deep Sea) | Δ Median |
| :----------------------------- | :-----------: | :---------------: | :------: |
| Mental Demand                  |      11       |        20         |    9     |
| Physical Demand                |      12       |        14         |    2     |
| Temporal Demand                |      25       |        30         |    5     |
| Frustration                    |      45       |        50         |    5     |
| Effort                         |      35       |        45         |    10    |
| Performance                    |      85       |        88         |    3     |
| **Overall Perceived Workload** |    **36**     |      **38**       |  **2**   |

> _Brief analysis: All 10 participants reported slight differences in overall workload in hard mode than in Easy mode (median 38 vs 36). The increase is small and consistent across participants; the Wilcoxon test (Table 2) found no statistically significant difference, suggesting the difficulty step did not substantially raise perceived workload._

<div align="center">
  <font color="#888888">Figure 20: Comparison of NASA TLX overall perceived workload scores across 10 participants (Easy vs. Deep Sea mode)</font>
  <br><br>
  <img src="docs/evaluation report figure/overal_workload.png" alt="NASA TLX Overall Workload by Participant" width="80%">
</div>
<br>

**Statistical Analysis**

A Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was performed for each subscale and for overall workload (N = 10, α = 0.05, critical value = 8). As shown in Table 6, the W statistic exceeded the critical value for all seven scales, indicating that the increase in difficulty did not produce a statistically significant difference in perceived workload at either the subscale or overall level.

Table 6: Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test Results (N = 10, α = 0.05, critical value = 8)

| Scale                | W Statistic | Critical Value | Significant? |
| :------------------- | :---------: | :------------: | :----------: |
| Mental Demand        |     12      |       8        |      No      |
| Physical Demand      |     15      |       8        |      No      |
| Temporal Demand      |     14      |       8        |      No      |
| Frustration          |     16      |       8        |      No      |
| Effort               |     13      |       8        |      No      |
| Performance          |     18      |       8        |      No      |
| **Overall Workload** |   **11**    |     **8**      |    **No**    |

**Solutions and Adjustments**

To create a meaningfully harder experience in hard mode, we implemented several design changes based on the codebase:

1. **target score +30%** and **shorter time limits** (25−levelNum seconds, min 15s) to raise pressure;
2. **faster fish** (1.3–1.8× speed) to increase aiming difficulty;
3. **more obstacles** (guard stones around treasure, 8–12 loose stones in deep sea) to complicate hook paths;
4. **sharks** that steal caught items during reel-up;
5. **limited visibility** (darkness layer with only a cone of light from the submarine) to add spatial uncertainty;
6. **different fish composition** (AnglerFish 400–800 pts, fewer but higher-value targets).

We also rebalanced the economy: **fish values** were adjusted (SmallFish 30–150→10–50, BigFish 250–600→150–350, Treasure 100–500→50–400) to better match level targets; the **shop** was changed from fixed prices to level-scaled pricing so upgrades remain attainable as difficulty rises. The NASA TLX results showed no statistically significant increase in perceived workload, suggesting these changes added challenge without overwhelming players.

#### System Usability Scale (SUS)

**Process**

After finishing the NASA-TLX evaluation, all 10 participants filled out the SUS questionnaire, a standardized tool with 10 questions to measure overall system usability (Lewis, 2018). We calculated scores following the standard SUS methodology.

**Results**

- Mean SUS score (easy) — **88.25**
- Mean SUS score (hard) — **75.0**

<div align="center">
  <font color="#888888">Figure 21: Comparison of System Usability Scale (SUS) scores across 10 participants (Easy vs. Hard mode)</font>
  <br><br>
  <img src="docs/evaluation%20report%20figure/sus_evaluation.png" alt="SUS Evaluation Results" width="80%">
</div>
<br>

Based on our SUS results, all participants rated both difficulty levels above the standard usability benchmark of 68, with Shallow Water averaging 88.25 and Deep Sea averaging 75.0. These scores indicate excellent perceived usability for the easier condition and solidly above‑average usability even in the more challenging Deep Sea mode, suggesting that the game remains easy to use across difficulty levels.

**Statistical Analysis**

A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was conducted to compare SUS scores between the Shallow Water and Deep Sea conditions. For a sample size of 10 at α = 0.05, the critical value of W was 8. The obtained test statistic did not exceed this critical value, indicating no statistically significant difference in perceived usability between the two difficulty levels.

**Solutions and Adjustments**

The SUS confirmed that both difficulty levels offered strong overall usability, but it was less informative for driving concrete design changes than our qualitative observations and NASA TLX workload ratings. Instead, we used the SUS primarily as a summative check to validate that the game provided a positive user experience across conditions. We also noticed indications of questionnaire fatigue, likely because participants completed the SUS immediately after the NASA TLX, which may have reduced how carefully they responded. for the future conduction , we plan to include short breaks or separate the SUS and NASA TLX into different sessions to lower cognitive load and improve response quality.

### 6.3 Black Box Testing

Black box testing was conducted by simulating realistic player actions and verifying externally observable outcomes only (UI feedback, score changes, state transitions, timing behaviour, and audio/visual responses), without relying on internal code structure.

### 6.4 White Box Testing

White box testing was conducted by designing tests from internal logic paths (branches, state transitions, boundary conditions, and fallback handling) in core modules, rather than testing only external behaviour.

#### Targeted Internal Areas

- Hook state transitions (`IDLE_SWINGING`, `MOVING_DOWN`, `MOVING_UP`)
- Collision and reward branches in `LevelManager` (fish, treasure, rock/fishbone, shark steal)
- Pricing and discount branches in `ShopItem` and purchase flow in `ShopManager`
- State-transition side effects in `GameManager` (UI sync and state-dependent flow)
- Local/cloud fallback logic in `HighScoreManager`

#### Representative White Box Cases

| Test Case | Module | Internal Path / Branch | Input / Setup | Expected Internal Outcome | Result |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| WB-H1 | `Hook` | `deployDown()` transition guard | Trigger deploy from `IDLE_SWINGING` and non-idle states | Valid transition only from idle state | Pass |
| WB-H2 | `Hook` | Retract speed branch | Retract with and without `attachedItem` | Weighted branch used only when item is attached | Pass |
| WB-L1 | `LevelManager` | Return-item reward branch | Simulate fish, treasure, rock, and fishbone returns | Correct score/effect branch executed per item type | Pass |
| WB-L2 | `LevelManager` | Shark collision branch | Simulate shark overlap with hooked fish vs rock/fishbone | Fish can be stolen; rock/fishbone ignored | Pass |

## 🌱 7. Sustainability

### 7.1 Sustainability Analysis Framework (SusAF) Results

We evaluated *Deep Sea Prospector* using SusAF across five key dimensions:

* **Technical:** A modular, object-oriented architecture (`GameManager`, `Hook`, `SeaItem`) minimizes technical debt and simplifies future feature extensions.
* **Environmental:** Optimized computation and selective rendering reduce device energy consumption during gameplay.
* **Individual:** Protects privacy (minimal data collection without sensitive identifiers), supports wellbeing (adjustable brightness), and ensures accessibility (simple, keyboard-first controls).
* **Social:** Co-op modes and shared leaderboards foster community, interaction, and friendly competition.
* **Economic:** Optimized cloud access (paginated queries, compact records) reduces bandwidth, storage, and long-term operating costs.

Overall, the design balances immediate playability with long-term sustainability: lowering maintenance and cloud costs while ensuring an inclusive experience.

### 7.2 Green Foundation Implementation Patterns

Our implementation aligns with practical green software patterns that improve both performance and sustainability outcomes:

- **Efficient algorithms:** Collision checks and state-driven update loops are designed to avoid redundant per-frame computation, especially in dense scenes.
- **Minimal resource usage:** Rendering and UI overlays are applied according to current state (for example, brightness and deep-sea visibility logic), preventing unnecessary full-scene processing.
- **Data minimisation:** Leaderboard records are stored as compact structured fields rather than large payloads, preserving essential analytics with lower transfer and storage cost.
- **Network efficiency:** Supabase leaderboard reads use bounded result windows and incremental loading (`limit=50`, dynamic `offset`) to prevent over-fetching. The ranking endpoint only requests required columns and ordering (for example, `order=levels_completed.desc,score.desc`), which reduces transfer size and cloud query overhead.
- **Modular architecture for sustainable evolution:** Class-based separation of concerns allows targeted optimisation without destabilising unrelated systems.

These patterns jointly reduce computational waste, improve responsiveness on lower-end devices, and support scalable deployment.

### 7.3 Sustainability User Stories and Green Software Foundation Patterns

To operationalise sustainability, we map concrete sustainability user stories to implemented features and measurable outcomes:

- **As a player, I want stable performance during gameplay, so that my device consumes less power and the game remains smooth.**  
We support this through selective update/render logic and lightweight per-frame processing in core loops.
- **As a privacy-conscious user, I want my gameplay data collected minimally, so that I can participate in rankings without exposing sensitive information.**  
We only persist non-sensitive score metadata required for ranking and collection features, and leaderboard fetching is restricted to lightweight ranked fields instead of full user profiles.
- **As a player, I want adjustable visual comfort settings, so that I can play for longer periods without unnecessary eye strain.**  
We provide brightness control in-game and keep core interaction readable under both normal and deep-sea visual conditions.
- **As a community player, I want fair shared progression systems, so that I can engage socially through competition and cooperation.**  
Two-player mode and cloud leaderboard features provide this social layer without high data overhead.
- **As a maintainer, I want code that is easy to extend and optimise, so that sustainability improvements remain feasible as the project grows.**  
Our OOP modular design enables incremental optimisation and future sustainability-focused refactoring.

For future work, we plan to formalise sustainability testing metrics (for example, frame-time stability, load-time targets, and API request efficiency) and include them in backlog and regression checks, ensuring sustainability remains a continuous engineering objective rather than a one-off report section.

## 🔄 8. Process



### 8.1 Teamwork & Development Workflow

Our process evolved iteratively, applying agile principles to manage increasing complexity:

* **Version Control & Structure:** We enforced small task scopes, frequent commits, and weekly branching. By week three, we established a shared code framework (Start, Shop, `GameManager`, `SeaItem`, Results) to standardize development.
* **Early Phase (Weeks 1-5):** Tasks were divided broadly into UI/Backend and Core Mechanics. We avoided rigid roles early on; instead, all members continuously playtested and provided cross-functional feedback.
* **Role Specialization (Week 7+):** As we transitioned to a unified pixel-art style, roles specialized into frontend asset optimization, mechanic algorithms, sound design, and backend refinement.
* **Balancing & Polish:** Following qualitative and quantitative playtesting, we heavily refined the scoring system and shop economy—iteratively testing linear vs. exponential algorithms to find the right difficulty balance.
* **Conflict Resolution:** As system integrations became more complex, natural disagreements arose. We resolved these through open communication, explaining reasoning clearly, and finalizing features through team consensus.

</div>
<br>

Our GitHub version control also improved a lot over time. What started as a process where we were not very familiar with handling conflicts eventually became something we managed smoothly and confidently. Since we also deployed the backend database relatively early, the backend playtest data became our main source of quantitative evaluation for game balance and playability, and this provided the foundation for assessing whether the algorithms and overall design were reasonable.



### 8.2 Tools used

**WeChat** as our primary communication tool:

Used to keep all group members updated on weekly progress and task status  
Used to quickly request support from teammates when blockers appeared  
Used to arrange the time and place of our next meetings and coordinate deadlines

  </div>

</div>
<br>

**GitHub** for version control:

Made sure we committed and pushed stable, working code to shared branches over time to reduce integration risks.  
This also meant that when errors or conflicts appeared, we could always roll back or  refer to the most recent stable version.
Kept commit history clear by using descriptive messages  
Used multiple branches for feature and debug development  and merged changes after they were completed and reviewed/tested  
Followed a structured integration workflow, including branch merges , so alway the latest updated version of working code would be merged to the main branch.

  <br><br>
  
  <img src="docs/evaluation%20report%20figure/list.png" width="65%" alt="Git Branch History">
</div>
<br>
**Kanban boards**:

Tracked the overall progress of tasks that needed to be completed  
Recorded which member completed each task, so ownership was clear when a finished task needed to be revisited  
Used individual sprint boards to further prioritize the tasks needed for each work session
<div align="center">
  <font color="#888888">Figure 28: Project Kanban Board</font>
  <br><br>

</div>
<br>

Using these tools gave the team a clearer view of current priorities and individual responsibilities. With frequent board updates, we were able to monitor progress continuously and adjust plans when new challenges emerged. Open communication helped us understand each other's perspectives, strengthen collaboration, and coordinate our work more effectively.

## 🤖 11. AI Statement

Throughout the development of Deep Sea Prospector, Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools were utilized selectively to assist with specific aspects of the project, ensuring efficiency while maintaining human creative control over the core design and mechanics. In accordance with academic integrity guidelines, our use of AI was transparently limited to the following two areas:

1. Game Asset Generation
We utilized generative Nanobanana2 to assist in the ideation and creation of 2D visual assets. AI was primarily used to draft initial concepts and generate raw image sprites for certain in-game elements, such as specific marine life and background textures. Following generation, all AI-assisted assets were heavily modified, cropped, and colour-corrected manually by our Asset Creators to ensure they matched our cohesive pixel-art aesthetic and met the precise hitbox requirements of our collision system.

  <img src="docs/assets/koifish2.png" alt="Final Edited Asset" width="400">
</div>

2. Test Script Generation
We employed Claude code to support our quality assurance process by assisting with the drafting of test code. AI tools were used to quickly generate boilerplate code, format test structures, and suggest edge-case scenarios for our physics and collision boundary tests. All AI-generated test scripts were strictly reviewed, refined, and verified by our Test Engineer to ensure they accurately reflected our system architecture and evaluated the correct acceptance criteria.

All core gameplay programming, object-oriented architecture design, level balancing (including the Expected Value Framework), and the drafting of this report were completed entirely by the human development team.
